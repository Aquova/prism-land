# Prism Land: The Board Game

Here are some ideas that we came up with during class. Feel free to change what you want.

## Parts

The game consists of board which has a 10x10 grid printed on it. Each player will be given a token of their own, and they will begin at the designated 'start' location of the board, and try to be the first to reach the 'end' location. Also on the board will be enemy token, which come in several different varieties. Each of these enemy tokens will have their own unique behavior. The board could be comprised of several different 'sub-boards' that can be assembled into a variety of different configurations, giving much more unique experiences.

## Mechanics

The players will take turns moving through across the grid.

### Movement Options

- Which each consecutive movement, the player will build 'momentum'. For example, the first two turns that the player keeps moving, they will only move one square at a time, but starting with the third consecutive turn, they are able to move 2 or 3 squares at a time. If they need to stop or change direction for any reason, this momentum will reset.
- The enemy tokens will have predetermined behaviors, such as simply moving back and forth or turning if a certain dice roll is achieved. There are also obstacles in the levels, such as 'bridges' which would provide a shorter route to the end, but require a certain dice roll the entire time the player in crossing, otherwise they will face some penalty.
- Each square on the board is assigned a number, which represents terrain. The higher the number, the harder it is to cross, taking more time/turns. This could simulate different slopes or different textures.
- Player 2 can pick obstacles around the course for player 1 to try to traverse. Player 1 won't know where they are located, and will have to uncover the tiles as they make their way through the game.

## Enemies/Obstacles

- Red Enemy (or whatever color) - Simply moves back and forth 3 or so squares, then goes back
- Green enemy - Goes back and forth, but if a certain dice value is rolled, then it will turn 90 degrees.
- Blue enemy - Will roll towards the nearest player.

- Keys - Door blocking the exit of the level can only be opened if the key has been gained
- Trampoline - Roll a dice, if you get a certain value you 'bounce' across to the other side. If you don't, you fall into the trap
- Bridges - While crossing, you need to continue rolling certain values. If you fail, then you get penalized.
- Death squares - Every few turns, certain squares become hazards, and if you are on them during that period, then you are penalized.
    - Some tiles will flip flop, while some are safe, others are dangerous and vice versa.
